    The <b>chicken (Gallus domesticus)</b> is a large and round short-winged bird, 
    domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. 
    Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are kept as pets or for cockfighting.

<p>
Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, 
and an annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. 
There are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.

    Chicken can mean a chick, as in William Shakespeare's play Macbeth, 
    where Macduff laments the death of "all my pretty chickens and their dam".
    The usage is preserved in placenames such as the Hen and Chicken Islands.
    In older sources, and still often in trade and scientific contexts, chickens as a species are described as common fowl or domestic fowl.

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. 
    The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short.
    Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly more than a short distance.
    Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.
    Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. 
    Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.
</p>
<p>
    Chickens are omnivores.
    In the wild, they scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and animals as large as lizards, small snakes, and young mice. 
    A chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.
    The world's oldest known chicken lived for 16 years.

<p>
    Chickens are gregarious, living in flocks, and incubate eggs and raise young communally. 
    Individual chickens dominate others, establishing a pecking order; dominant individuals take priority for access to food and nest sites. 
    The concept of dominance, involving pecking, was described in female chickens by Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe in 1921 as the "pecking order".
    Male chickens tend to leap and use their claws in conflicts.
    Chickens are capable of mobbing and killing a weak or inexperienced predator, such as a young fox
</p>
<p>
    A male's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call, serving as a territorial signal to other males,and in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. 
    Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg and to call their chicks. 
    Chickens give different warning calls to indicate that a predator is approaching from the air or on the ground.
